# `node_modules`

The package manager of your choice (such as `npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, or `bun`) generates this directory to store your projectâ€™s dependencies.

::: tip

To avoid tracking dependencies in version control, make sure this directory is listed in your [`.gitignore`](/docs/directory-structure/gitignore.md) file.
