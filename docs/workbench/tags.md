# Tags

Tags are used to further structure your data items.

::: info
As the Permission system is currently not fully rolled out, the only way to give admin access is by setting the ADMIN tag. This tag can not be changed via the api and should not be changed directly in the database.

## Tag List

In the tag list view, you can create new tags or edit existing ones.

<ThemeImage 
  light-src="/graphics/workbench/tags/list-light.png"
  dark-src="/graphics/workbench/tags/list-dark.png"
  alt="Tag List"
/>

## Create/Edit Tags

The Edit and Creation Dialogues are identical. Here you can define the metadata of your tag

<ThemeImage 
  light-src="/graphics/workbench/tags/edit-light.png"
  dark-src="/graphics/workbench/tags/edit-dark.png"
  alt="Tag Edit"
/>
