# Users

Users are, as you may have guessed, the useraccounts for your platform/portal.

::: info
As the Permission system is currently not fully rolled out, the only way to give access to the workbench is by setting the "ADMIN" tag to the user in question. This will be replaced by the actual permission system during the beta phase

## User List

In the user list view, you can create new users or edit existing ones.

<ThemeImage 
  light-src="/graphics/workbench/users/list-light.png"
  dark-src="/graphics/workbench/users/list-dark.png"
  alt="User List"
/>

## Create/Edit Users

The Edit and Creation Dialogues are identical. Here you define the basic user data for login and identification purposes

<ThemeImage 
  light-src="/graphics/workbench/users/edit-light.png"
  dark-src="/graphics/workbench/users/edit-dark.png"
  alt="User Edit"
/>
