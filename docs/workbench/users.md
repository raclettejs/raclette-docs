# Users

Users are, as you may have guessed, the useraccounts for your platform/portal.

::: info
As the Permission system is currently not fully rolled out, the only way to give access to the workbench is by setting the "ADMIN" tag to the user in question. This will be replaced by the actual permission system during the beta phase
