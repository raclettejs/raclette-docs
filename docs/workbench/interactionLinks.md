# Interaction Links

Interaction Links define how and where your compositions are rendered. For now raclette supports clickable links in the page navigation and user menu which can either render a composition in a modal or as a page.

## Interaction Link List

In the interaction link list view, you can create new interaction links or edit existing ones.

## Create/Edit Interaction Links

The Edit and Creation Dialogues are identical. Here you can define meta data for the link, what composition is triggered and how.
