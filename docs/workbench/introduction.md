# raclette Workbench

The raclette Workbench is a built-in interface that ships with every Raclette installation. It serves as the central control panel for managing and configuring your project — without the need to write code.

The workbench is primarily designed for **admin users**, not developers. It provides a visual interface for defining the structure, views, and interactions of the application.

By default, the raclette Workbench is accessible at: [`http://localhost:8083/`](http://localhost:8083/)

## First-Time Setup

When opening the raclette Workbench for the first time, you’ll be guided through a setup wizard to create your first project. During this process, you’ll:

- Choose a name for your application
- Register an initial admin user
- Finalize the project setup

Once the project is initialized, you can begin configuring it right away.

## What You Can Do

The raclette Workbench allows you to:

- Create and manage **Compositions**
- Define **Interaction Links**
- Configure application-level settings and behavior

This tool empowers non-developer administrators to customize the application for their end users through an intuitive UI — all without editing the underlying codebase.
