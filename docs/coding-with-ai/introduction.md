# Developing Plugins with AI (Vibe Coding)

Welcome to the fun part! racletteJS is designed to be modular at scale and to make **vibe coding** with AI assistants not just possible, but actually enjoyable and maintainable. For simple use cases there is no need to be a "real developer" – if you can describe what you want and work with an AI, you can build plugins.

## Why racletteJS Supports Vibe Coding

Here's the secret sauce: racletteJS plugins use straightforward TypeScript and Vue. No weird abstractions, no complex build chains to explain to your AI. The boilerplate handles all the gnarly stuff (frontend/backend communication, core integration), so your AI can focus on what you're actually trying to build.

## Your AI's Best Friend: Context7

We've made our entire documentation available through Context7, which means your AI assistant can learn everything about racletteJS in seconds.

**Here's how to supercharge your AI:**

1. Visit [Context7s GitHub Page](https://github.com/upstash/context7) and look for the (AI) tool of your choice. You should find a guide how to include Context7.
2. When prompting tell the ai to "lookup racletteJS" and to "use context7"
3. The AI should query do two queries: one where it asks Context7 for "racletteJS" and if it finds the library another one with the question the AI has.

Alternative approach:

1. Visit [racletteJS on Context7](https://context7.com/gitlab_raclettejs/docs)
2. Copy this URL and paste it into your AI chat
3. Tell your AI: "Reference this Context7 documentation to help me build a racletteJS plugin"

Now your AI knows the framework inside-out. Pretty neat, right?

## Starting with the Plugin Blueprint

We provide a plugin blueprint that gives you a running start. Think of it as a pre-built skeleton that already handles all the boring core integration stuff. In a future release this boilerplate will be mostly stripped away and the rest will be autogenerated, so bear with us!

**Get the blueprint here:** [https://gitlab.com/raclettejs/pluginexamples/-/tree/main/plugins/raclette\_\_boilerplate](https://gitlab.com/raclettejs/pluginexamples/-/tree/main/plugins/raclette__boilerplate?ref_type=heads)

When working with your AI, share this blueprint and explain what you want to build. The AI will understand the structure and help you fill in your custom logic.

## The Golden Rule: Keep It in the Widget

Here's the one architectural thing you should keep in mind:

**Your `*Widget.vue` file is the bridge between your plugin and racletteJS core.**

This file is special – it's where all the core-tied behavior lives. Everything else? Totally up to you!

### What This Means in Practice

```
my-plugin/
├── raclette.plugin.ts # Main plugin configuration
├── frontend/ # Frontend-side code (if frontendDir specified)
│ ├── [...] # See plugin metadata for more
│ ├── composables  ← Organize these however you want
│ ├── components  ← Organize these however you want
│ └── widgets/ # Plugin widgets
│     └── FOLDERNAME/ # Your custom Widget folder name (optional)
│         ├── NameWidget.vue # The widget File. Needs to follow this structure "[CustomName]Widget.vue"
│         └── setup.ts # Contains details and config for the widget
└── backend/ # Server-side code (if backendDir specified)
    └── [...] # See plugin metadata for more
```

**Your `*Widget.vue` should:**

- Handle all communication with the racletteJS core using the provided `pluginAPI`
- Pass data down to your child components via props or models
- Keep your business logic separate the core business logic (makes life easier later!)

**Your child components can:**

- Be organized any way you like
- Use any naming conventions you prefer
- Have whatever structure makes sense for your use case

The blueprint gives you a working `*Widget.vue` – your AI can help you customize it for your needs while keeping that core connection intact. Simply replace the `*` with your widgetname

## Pro Tips for Vibe Coding Plugins

### 1. Be Specific About Data Flow

Tell your AI: "I need the component to render data in a datatable, use the provided prop `items`"

### 2. Separate Concerns

Good vibes: Keep core logic in `*Widget.vue`, UI and custom component logic in child components  
Bad vibes: Mixing everything together (you'll thank yourself later)

### 3. Use Props and Models Wisely

- **Props**: For passing data down to child components
- **Models**: For two-way data binding when needed
- **Recommendation**: Pass everything your component needs from the Widget, don't make child components talk to the core directly

### 4. Let the Boilerplate kick start your project

The boilerplate provides a foundation for:

- Frontend ↔ Backend communication
- Core integration and lifecycle
- All the plumbing you don't want to think about but should be known until we habe our code generation in place

You focus on: Your actual feature!

## Example AI Prompt

Here's a sample prompt to get you started:

```
You are an expert vue3 and racletteJS developer with modern es6 approaches and vue3 best practices in mind:
I want to build a racletteJS plugin that [describes your feature].

I'm using the plugin boilerplate from
https://gitlab.com/raclettejs/pluginexamples/-/tree/main/plugins/raclette__boilerplate

Please reference the racletteJS documentation at
https://context7.com/gitlab_raclettejs/docs

Plese rewrite the backend files to fit the naming, model and schema structure discussed earlier. Locate all i18n keys in the index.ts of the frontend directory. Make sure that all $store and $data pluginApi calls stay in the *Widget.vue file. Provide all necessary contents to the respective child components.
```

## Need Help?

Remember: the beauty of vibe coding is iteration. Don't expect perfection on the first try. Work with your AI, test things out, and refine. racletteJS's straightforward structure means fixes are usually simple.

Happy vibing! 🧀✨
